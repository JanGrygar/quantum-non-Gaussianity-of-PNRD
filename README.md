# Quantum non-Gaussianity of photon-number-resolving detectors

This repository provides data and code to the paper **Quantum non-Gaussianity certification of photon-number-resolving detectors**, preprint: [arXiv:xxxx.xxxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx), by Jan Grygar, Josef Hloušek, Jaromír Fiurášek, and Miroslav Ježek.

fig3_nq.txt, fig3_ns.txt, fig3.py
- data and Python script for producing Figure 3 of the paper
- the figure shows photon distributions of probe thermal states

Fig4.dat, Fig4.py
- data and Python script for producing Figure 4 of the paper
- the figure shows the quantum non-Gaussianity certification of the photon-number-resolving detector using the vacuum state and two thermal states



All the scripts were prepared and tested with Python 3.8.12, Numpy 1.19.4, and Matplotlib 3.5.0.

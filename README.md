- data and Python script for producing Figure 5 of the paper
- the figure shows the quantum non-Gaussianity certification of the PNRD for increasing level of background noise

fig6.txt, fig6.py
- data and Python script for producing Figure 6 of the paper
- the figure shows the quantum non-Gaussianity certification of the PNRD using noise addition
